			<h1>Introducing plugin support!</h1>
			<p>
				Wurm Assistant 3.1 is here and with it, brand new plugin support!
			</p>
			<p>
				What is a plugin? This is basically an alternative to hacking the source of Wurm Assistant and begging with pull requests, just to add some feature.
			</p>
			<p>
				Making a plugin is, I dare say, simple. There are a few steps of arguably magic, but from there, it's like making a fresh app.
				Any additional Wurm Assistant magic is completely opt-in.
				I've made a quick <a href="https://github.com/mdsolver/WurmAssistant3/wiki/Plugin-Quick-Start">guide</a> for adventurers willing to try out this system.
			</p>
			<h3>Wurm updates may break Wurm Assistant.</h3>
			<p>
				Recently devs started to improve in-game log messages. Since most of Wurm Assistant is depending on those, it is likely something will get broken.
				I do not have time to track these upcoming breaking changes, nor the means to ensure they can be prevented. This means WA might get broken now and then
				and I'm completely dependent on your bug reports to fix it as soon as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/141408-changes-to-text-coming-in-the-may-24th-update/">Here</a>
				is my take on the whole thing and I'd encourage you to voice your opinion, if you agree with me there.
			</p>
            <p>
                Another source of minor bugs will come from my efforts to improve some source code.
                This is unlikely to result in new major features, but I'm using Wurm Assistant as my portfolio project
                and some of it's code is really dated and feels unprofessional.
            </p>
            <h3>Secret new project!</h3>
            <p>
                I'm working on a secret new project and it might prove useful for Wurm community and similar sandbox games.
                I can't say anything more at the moment (I know, teasing!), as it all depends on how my career turns out in the coming months.
                Stay tuned for more news!
