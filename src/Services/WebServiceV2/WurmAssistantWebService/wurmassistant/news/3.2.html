			<h2>Triggers import/export!</h2>
			<p>
				After many eons of incredibly sophisticated development, this marvelous new feature has come to save the Wurld of Wurm Assistant!
			</p>
			<p>
				A few triggers within any character config can now be selected and exported to a text file as JSON format.
				These files can then be imported into any other character config.
				Should importer notice a trigger already exists for this character, it will kindly ask what to do.
			<p>
				And for the true power users, with a bit of JSON editing and scripting, entire sets of triggers can be made without having to go through the GUI!
			</p>
			<p>
				As an extra convenience for dealing with imported triggers, the 'Delete' keyboard key can now be used to remove all currently selected triggers at once.
			</p>
			<h3>Data upgrade for Triggers feature!</h3>
			<p>
				Recently a major data upgrade has been done for triggers features. I am glad nobody noticed it, because it means it worked flawlessly!
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, should anyone actually stumble upon an issue, 
				<a href="http://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/68031-wurm-assistant-enrich-your-wurm-experience/&do=findComment&comment=1478670">here</a> 
				is a quick recovery guide.
			</p>
			<h3>Happy wurming!</h3>
